    "### Summary and taking it further\n",
    "\n",
    " - Cython is a relatively mature Python technology (compared to say numba or mpi4py), providing an opportunity to do thread-based parallel programming when we can guarantee not to use Python objects in our code, but instead translate it to 'lower level' Cython code. \n",
    "\n",
    " - Cython's `cython.parallel` module provides an interface to OpenMP - a type of shared memory parallel programming model suited to multicore CPU systems. (I.e. single-node on a cluster, multicore desktop/laptop computer). Much of the OpenMP API can be accessed through this module. \n",
    " \n",
    " - However, the user may still stick to the basics of functions like `prange` and `with nogil...` to access simple parallelism techniques without needing an indepth knowledge of OpenMP.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Cython requires more programming effort time compared to something like `numba`, but offers finer grained control, interoperability with C and C++ code, and access to some of the power of the OpenMP library. (We have not covered interoperability with C code, but other tutorials and resources on this are available.\n",
